This is how my site works. For future reference.

## The Stack

The site is built with [GatsbyJS](http://gatsbyjs.org) and hosted on
[Netlify](http://netlify.com).

I can develop locally and push to
[github](https://github.com/mattchupp/mattchupp). The site automatically builds
on netlify via commit-hook.

All blog posts are written in markdown. I write the post locally and push to github to update.
