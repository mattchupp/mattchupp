The [Reverb Conference](https://github.com/mattchupp/reverb_conference) is a yearly youth conference put on by
[The Vineyard Church](http://thevineyardchurch.us).
I have been updating this site for the last few years, but this one is my favorite.
I really liked the simplicity of the site.

## The Tools

Previous years I created a simple static site using various CSS frameworks or custom stylesheets.
The latest site was built with [GatsbyJS](http://gatsbyjs.org). For the style I
wanted something clean and very simple. The graphic and video for the conference
is black & white so I figured the site should resemble that too.
I'm using [UIKit](https://getuikit.com) for most of the styling.
