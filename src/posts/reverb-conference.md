The [Reverb Conference](https://reverb.us) is a yearly youth conference put on by
[The Vineyard Church](http://thevineyardchurch.us).
I have been updating this site for the last few years, but this one is my favorite.
I really like simplicity in design. I think sites should have just the information
people *need* and not have it cluttered with other random things.

## The Tools

The latest site was built with [GatsbyJS](http://gatsbyjs.org). For the style I
wanted something clean and very simple. The graphic and video for the conference
is black & white so I figured the site should resemble that too.
The inspiration for the site came from [Young Saints](https://youngsaints.com/conference).
I'm using [UIKit](https://getuikit.com) for the styling and a little bit of custom CSS for a few things.
