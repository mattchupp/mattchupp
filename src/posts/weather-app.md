I recently started learning React after many different attempts. I had tried before, but never really put it to use. I wanted to change that. I wanted to make a web app that gets real data from an API. I really like weather, so this was an easy decision.

Itâ€™s not really useful considering how many other weather applications are way better, but it was fun making it! I use the [Zip Code API](https://www.zipcodeapi.com) to get the coordinates from a zip code and [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net) to get the weather data. Made with React (of course!) and hosted on Netlify.

*Update: Dark Sky was [recently bought by Apple](https://blog.darksky.net) and the API is going away in 2020. Sadness.*

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1d5a6144-f5f6-4ce8-b7cd-ad606f754762/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/reactjs-weather/deploys)

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Get current location instead of typing zip code in
- [ ] Allow input for cities and zip codes
- [ ] Update design
- [ ] Display more data
- [ ] Find new API for weather data
