I recently started learning ReactJS after many different attempts. I have *learned* it multiple times before, but never really used it past the tutorials. This time I decided to change that. I wanted to make a web app. I wanted to make something that gets real data from a real API. So why not make a weather app? 

Itâ€™s not really useful, but it was fun making it! I use the [Zip Code API](https://www.zipcodeapi.com) to get the coordinates from a zip code and [Dark Sky](http://darksky.net) to get the weather data. Made with React (of course!) and hosted on Netlify.
