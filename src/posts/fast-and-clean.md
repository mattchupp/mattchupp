This is how my site works. This is mainly for me later on, but you can see it too!

## The Stack

The site is built with [GatsbyJS](http://gatsbyjs.org) and hosted on
[Netlify](http://netlify.com).

This set up is great! I can develop locally and push to
[github](https://github.com/mattchupp/mattchupp). Netlify and Github are
integrated pretty closely so my site builds automatically after I push to Github.

Also, did I mention this setup is crazy fast?
