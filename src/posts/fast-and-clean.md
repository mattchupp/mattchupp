I wouldn't call myself an expert in web development, but there is something I
strive for when it comes to make sites â€” make it fast & clean.

I have messed around with a lot of web development tools and blogging platforms
(Ghost, Medium, Wordpress, CraftCMS, Jekyll, HTML, JS, etc.). They all have things
I like about them and things I hate. I really liked the idea of Jekyll as a
static site generator, but I like Javascript over Ruby. Wordpress is great for
blogging, but I don't like messing with themes. I think Medium & Ghost great if
you want a blog, but not great for my needs.

Here comes [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org). I heard about GatsbyJS on Twitter and
I LOVE Gatsby. It's easy to use and easy to understand. I can have a static site
built with React? Sign me up! So here we are.

This is how my site works. This is mainly for me later on, but you can see it too!

## The Stack

The site is built with [GatsbyJS](http://gatsbyjs.org) and hosted on
[Netlify](http://netlify.com).

This set up is great! I can develop locally and push to
[github](https://github.com/mattchupp/mattchupp). Netlify and Github are
integrated pretty closely so my site builds automatically after I push to Github.

Also, did I mention this setup is crazy fast? That's the main reason I love Gatsby
so much. They pride themselves in being a 'blazin fast'.
