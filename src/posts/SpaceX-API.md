I have been a big fan of Space for a long, long time. So this project was a lot of fun. I came across an [open sourced API ](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) for SpaceX data. 

The outcome of the project can be found [here](https://spacex.mthyu.com). The code is public on [github](https://github.com/mattchupp/spacex-wiki).
